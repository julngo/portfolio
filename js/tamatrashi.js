They love your attention! However, it turns out your beloved pet is actually kind of a brat and is very touchy. Make them happy! You\’ve got to, you\’re their parent! Who said this would be easy...or even plausible. You\’ll soon find that raising your very own Tamatrashi isn\’t as fun as you thought it would be.\"</p> <p>Tamatrashi is a basic pet caring game. The players have to keep their pet\’s statistics high while managing their money at the same time. This game was made so that the player cannot win. We studied the philosophical idea of absurdism and was tasked with making an absurd game.</p><p>March – June 2018</p><p>My role was the developer and graphic artist</p>  <a href="games/Tamatrashi_Window_Build.zip" download><div class="butn"><p>Window OS Version</p></div></a> <a href="games/Tamatrashi_Mac_Build.zip" download><div class="butn"><p>Mac OS Version</p></div></a>  </div><div  class="section" id="sect-2"><h2>ABSURDISM & IDEATION</h2><p>Absurdism is a philosophical idea that refers to the conflict between a goal and the inability to reach said goal. Sisyphus is a man who has been condemned to push a boulder up a hill but have it roll back to the bottom again. Albert Camus wrote <i>The Myth of Sisyphus</i> and introduces his philosophy of the absurd and argues that Sisyphus is happy even if he is condemned to repeat the same meaningless task, never to accomplish it.</p><p>In terms of making a game absurd, we had to look at games we thought allowed the players to enjoy the game but is impossible to accomplish the given goal. Some games we explored was Saved the Date and Tickets Please. These games are both unique because no matter what the player does, they will always lose, and they don’t find out that they can’t win until they play for a while. </p><img id="save_the_date_icon" src="images/save_the_date_icon.png"><p><a href="http://paperdino.com/save-the-date/">Save the Date</a> is played like a graphic novel where a story is written out and the player chooses different options. In this game, the player is initially given the task to go out on a date but later finds out that he needs to save them from bizarre happenings. </p><img id="papers_please" src="images/Papers_Please.jpg"><p><a href="http://papersplea.se/">Papers, Please</a> places the player in the role of an immigration inspector. You inspect documents provided by the immigrants and allow them to legally pass, turn them down, or allow them to pass with consequences to your paycheck that goes towards caring for your family. As the game progresses, the player is given more restrictions for documents and less money per immigrant while bills increase. </p><p>We wanted to draw some inspiration from other genres of game besides survival. We eventually came to a game that several of us played in the past, Tomogatchi games from Bandai.  We wanted to put a lot of different ideas to make the game in depth but had to cut back because of time restraints and unnecessary features. </p></div><div  class="section" id="sect-3"><h2>DEVELOPMENT</h2><p>Pixel art was the main style of the game. These are the assets that I made for the game. We wanted to eventually make the pet’s statistics bars fill or empty as the numbers changed but didn’t have time to implement it in. We used unity to code the game, heavily relying on online tutorials and feedback from classmates.</p><img src="images/Food.png"><img src="images/Happiness.png"><img src="images/heart.png"><img src="images/Hygiene.png"></div><div class="section" id="sect-4"><h2>Reflection</h2><p>I believe the game was a success overall. We were able to complete a playable version of the game and met our initial design goals. If I were given more time to add more onto this game, I would make more interactions between the player and the pet as well as have different rooms. I would also like to add more depth into the game, such as a story or more narrative surrounding the animal.</p><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/19xhwOGU0xjLQXWeqNG6NVZxXOVFCdBoGisKjxHxXqgo/edit?usp=sharing" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><div class="butn"><p>Link to Game Design Document</p></div><a></div>';
