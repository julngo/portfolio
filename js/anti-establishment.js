The game took place at the University of Washington Bothell campus where the players followed a map and actorâ€™s information to gather evidence. This three month endeavor was focused on researching causes of environmental change, what kinds of corporations have negative influences, and a study to create engaging methods of raising awareness in our campus community through the process of iteration of ideas and content, user research play-testing, marketing, and execution.</p> <p> A large part of the project included creating the experience. In order to do that, we focused on marketing and building the experience that leads into the game. This included us building a website, creating and updating a Twitter and Instagram account, and print posters around the campus.</p> <h3> Game Day Execution <h3><div class="iframe-container"><iframe width="100%" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2yOEXXb2rrk" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe> </div>';
